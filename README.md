# UrbanAfricaJupyter

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements the Urban Africa Labelling tool, guiding the user to provide the relevant information through the command line. This will run in Google Colab for the user with no Python installation, though significant speedups can be expected from using a multi-core machine. Simply run the notebook and follow the guidance.
